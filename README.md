# Introduction to brushwood fences for supporting damaged coasts
This is an example of a study case for building a master programe which is based on [Tung Dao Ph.D. thesis](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:0251e545-2b71-4eb9-b755-def24a3e0da6). The thesis is about hydraulic performance of wooden fences applied in the Mekong Delta.

## About Tung Dao research
In the past decade the role of wooden fences, containing brushwood and branches, in efforts to restoring mangroves has been recognized since a vast reduction of mangroves occurred along the Mekong deltaic coast. This study aims to better understand the hydrodynamic performance related to the possible mechanism of wave reduction and the influence of wave characteristics on wave damping due to wooden fences and, in this study, brushwood fences in particular.

[The brushwood fence or dam](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11zm1OStK9D_ZhLGszBrhvxqLhdP3CH8G/view?usp=sharing) (used in Indonesia and Suriname) is a soft/green infrastructure used to support a damaged coast. It could be used in either a mangrove coast that already suffered from a mass reduction or an eroded coast. The common structure of the brushwood fence has two main parts, the frame and the inner parts. The frame consists of a large bamboo/tree with a diameter from 8-10 cm forming into two to three parallel rows. The frame has a very low permeable value, in another way, the purpose is to keep inner parts in place. The inner parts construct bunches of tree/bamboo branches with an average diameter of 1-2 cm. The average porosity value of the inner parts is about 80% to 90% which is enough for damping wave energy and promoting sediments and nutrient for mangroves. Although the efficiency of wooden fence on damping waves is presented clearly in Tung Dao thesis, the statement about sediment transport through brushwood fences is carrying out in the future research.

In Tung Dao research, data from experiments, physical and numerical modeling were collected to obtain the background knowledge of the interaction between flows (and waves) and circular cylinders. Firstly, the interaction between flows and cylinders (an array of random cylinders or a random arrangement of cylinders) was investigated to obtain the proper bulk drag coefficient (Cd) for a particular arrangement of the fence's inner part in the separated experiments. The Cd, then, can be used to calibrate the numerical model, [SWASH](http://swash.sourceforge.net/), alongside with the physical data obtained from the wave flume tests. Further investigation about nonlinear waves and wooden fences then was studied by the SWASH model. The relationship between nonlinear waves might play an important role in the sediment transport in the Mekong deltaic coast, and the fence's characteristics were then carried out. Finally, the application of the SWASH model in the real boundary conditions, such as waves and topography, was studied.

This Ph.D. research can finally bring out the knowledge gaps that the previous literature was failed to find. However, there are more contents needed to study, for example, the 2D and 3D studies on hydraulic display for the fence, wave, and flow, and especially, the sediment transport as well as coming back to the goal that is to restore mangrove loss along the Mekong deltaic coasts.

## Course attempt

This study case is for every student who is interested in nature-based solutions for supporting the coasts. The title of this study case can be summarized as "Introduction to brushwood fences for supporting damaged coasts". Due to the Mekong deltaic coast is quite specific, thus, students can apply the content to any coast. Moreover, students can base on this case to freely build different cases. 

To follow it, students need to take place many courses that can be found in [here](https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/TUDelft/Onderwijs/Opleidingen/Master/MSc_Civil_Engineering/HE/Brochure%20MSc-HE%20academic%20year%202020-2021.pdf). However, the background knowledge of coastal engineering can be the main concern, such as Ocean waves (CIE4325), Coastal dynamics I (CIE4305) and II (CIE4309), Ports and Waterways I (CIE4330), Computational Modelling of Flow and Transport (CIE4340), Breakwaters and Closure Dams (CIE5308). Students also need to follow several courses in Specialisation Environmental Fluid Mechanics. For example, Turbulence in Hydraulics (CIE5312), Computational Hydraulics (CIE5325), Coastal and Basin-scale Physical Oceanography (CIE5315). Moreover, several elective courses are needed to follow, such as Hydraulic Structures (CIE5313-18), Sediment Dynamics (CIE4308), and more.

The content of this study case can be separated into serval sections:
1. Coastal engineering
 * Background of the coast 
 * Coastal hydro- and morpho-dynamics
2. Waves
 * Understanding waves and their characteristics (CIE4325)
 * Short- and long-terms wave statistics and calculations (CIE4325, CIE4305)
 * Wave propagation and transformation from offshore to nearshore (CIE4325, CIE4305)
3. Coastal protection
 * Background of coastal structures and protection solutions (CIE4305, CIE5308, CIE5313-18, CIE5315, & CIE5308)
 * Understanding fluid mechanics and structures (CIE5312, CIE5313-18, & CIE5308)
 * Nature-based solutions
4. Fluid mechanics in wooden fences and vegetation (mangroves)
 * Flow and a cylinder
 * Flow inside an array of cylinders and random arrangement cylinders
 * Wave, wave-induced flow inside an array of cylinders
5. Numerical model
 * SWASH
 * SWAN
 * And many others
6. Physical model
 * Experimental equipments
7. Coastal management
 * Integration of coastal management

There are indeed many other contents that are based on students' imagination. It is highly appreciated for building more cases and contents.
