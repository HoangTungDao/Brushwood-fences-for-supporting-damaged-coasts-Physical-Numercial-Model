In the past decade the role of wooden fences, containing brushwood and branches, in efforts to restoring mangroves has been recognized since a vast reduction of mangroves occurred along the Mekong deltaic coast. This study aims to better understand the hydrodynamic performance related to the possible mechanism of wave reduction and the influence of wave characteristics on wave damping due to wooden fences and, in this study, brushwood fences in particular.<br>

The brushwood fence or permeable dam (used in Indonesia and Suriname) is a soft/green infrastructure used to support a damaged coast. It could be used in either a mangrove coast that already suffered from a mass reduction or an eroded coast. The common structure of the brushwood fence has two main parts, the frame and the inner parts. The frame consists of a large bamboo/tree with a diameter from 8-10 cm forming into two to three parallel rows. The frame has a very low permeable value, in another way, the purpose is to keep inner parts in place. The inner parts construct bunches of tree/bamboo branches with an average diameter of 1-2 cm. The average porosity value of the inner parts is about 80% to 90% which is enough for damping wave energy and promoting sediments and nutrient for mangroves.<br>

Although the efficiency of wooden fence on damping waves is presented in previous studies, for example, [Schmitt et al., (2013)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11852-013-0253-4) and [Van Cuong et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092585741500141X?casa_token=T94qsQ_WeyYAAAAA:_vqISz67Pgc_q6Q7hZicOiXsKmOt6JpABgbuPfc6DRr3i8YcC95UKu246WRtkHEIlosDZHs7), the understanding in how waves and flows reduced inside this structure is also needed to dig deeper. Recently, [Tung Dao Ph.D. thesis](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:0251e545-2b71-4eb9-b755-def24a3e0da6) presents a background knowledge of interactions between waves and flows under the analysis experimental data and dataset from physical and numerical modeling. Firstly, the interaction between flows and cylinders (an array of random cylinders or a random arrangement of cylinders) was investigated to obtain the proper bulk drag coefficient ($\overline{C_d}$) for a particular arrangement of the fence's inner part in the separated experiments. The $\overline{C_d}$, then, can be used to calibrate the numerical model, [SWASH](http://swash.sourceforge.net/), alongside with the physical data obtained from the wave flume tests. Further investigation about nonlinear waves and wooden fences then was studied by the SWASH model. The relationship between nonlinear waves might play an important role in the sediment transport in the Mekong deltaic coast, and the fence's characteristics were then carried out. Finally, the application of the SWASH model in the real boundary conditions, such as waves and topography, was studied. This Ph.D. research can partly bring out the knowledge gaps that the previous literature was failed to find. However, there are more contents needed to study, for example, the 2D and 3D studies on hydraulic display for the fence, wave, and flow, and especially, the sediment transport as well as coming back to the goal that is to restore mangrove loss along the Mekong deltaic coasts.<br><br>
